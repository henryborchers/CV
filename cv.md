Broadcast Digitization Librarian
University of Maryland, College Park, Libraries, College Park, MD
Description:
The University of Maryland Libraries Post-MLS Residency Program is designed to provide dynamic new librarians with a supportive environment for professional exploration in academic librarianship, and an opportunity for concentrated experience in an area of specialization. The Broadcast Media Digitization Librarian Post-MLS Residency provided an opportunity for me as a new librarian to exercise leadership in the development and implementation of policies and practices relating to the management, reformatting, and preservation of audiovisual holdings at the University of Maryland Libraries. This position played a vital role in moving towards more integrated digital services between the major units in the Libraries with audiovisual holdings. In this position I worked with the staff of Special Collections, the Performing Arts Library, and Nonprint Media Services to develop a framework for managing audiovisual digital assets. A major focus of this position involved identifying reformatting options pertinent to content specifically associated with the Broadcasting Archives and working with librarians to formulate a more cohesive collection management plan for analog and digital audiovisual holdings. Included in this work was identifying appropriate metadata to capture, managing access and preservation of newly-created digital assets, and solidifying workflows for audiovisual digital conversion. In this position, I maintain professional familiarity with current trends in audiovisual digitization and make recommendations for UMD Libraries’ best practices.

Thesis:
Preserving Video Games: Through Its Textual and Contextual Components.
 
Proper preservation of video games requires equal attention to the textual and contextual components. Because the texts and contexts of video games are more tightly intertwined than other types of preserved content, failing to preserve both aspects fundamentally neuters any preservation efforts. This thesis problematizes video game preservation by exploring the text and contextual components and how they relate.

Metadata: Organizing and Discovering Information
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
Though Cousera.com Verified Certificate
 
Course Description:
If you use nearly any digital technology, you make use of metadata. Use an ATM today? You interacted with metadata about your account. Searched for songs in iTunes or Spotify? You used metadata about those songs. We use and even create metadata constantly, but we rarely realize it. Metadata — or data about data — describes real and digital objects, so that those objects may be organized now and found later.
Metadata is a tool that enables the information age functions performed by humans as well as those performed by computers. Metadata is important to many fields, particularly Computer Science; but this course is not purely a Computer Science course. This course approaches Metadata from the perspective of Information Science, which is a broad interdisciplinary field that studies how people create and manage information.

A/V Tech Basics for Archivists
Association of the Moving Image Archivists
Association of the Moving Image Archivists 2013 Annual Conference. Richmond, VA
 
Workshop Description:
Audio and video equipment is complex and specialized.  There are rules and best practices for using this  equipment properly, but this information is often not taught well, or at all.  It’s left to the archivist in the field  to learn by trial and error, or through colleagues, how equipment and systems are supposed to function.  This  workshop will provide fundamental technical knowledge that is needed to understand, connect and operate  equipment that archivists use on a daily basis‐‐including video displays, audio mixers, VTRs and associated  devices.  We will discuss proper interconnection, operation and troubleshooting, with an emphasis on  practical application, plus some underlying theory.
