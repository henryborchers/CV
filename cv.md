* 2009-2011

#### Thesis:
Preserving Video Games: Through Its Textual and Contextual Components.
 
Proper preservation of video games requires equal attention to the textual and contextual components. Because the texts and contexts of video games are more tightly intertwined than other types of preserved content, failing to preserve both aspects fundamentally neuters any preservation efforts. This thesis problematizes video game preservation by exploring the text and contextual components and how they relate.

### Metadata: Organizing and Discovering Information
* July 14, 2014 - September 9, 2014
* University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill

Though Cousera.com Verified Certificate
 
##### Course Description:
If you use nearly any digital technology, you make use of metadata. Use an ATM today? You interacted with metadata about your account. Searched for songs in iTunes or Spotify? You used metadata about those songs. We use and even create metadata constantly, but we rarely realize it. Metadata — or data about data — describes real and digital objects, so that those objects may be organized now and found later.
Metadata is a tool that enables the information age functions performed by humans as well as those performed by computers. Metadata is important to many fields, particularly Computer Science; but this course is not purely a Computer Science course. This course approaches Metadata from the perspective of Information Science, which is a broad interdisciplinary field that studies how people create and manage information.

### A/V Tech Basics for Archivists
* November 5, 2013
* Association of the Moving Image Archivists
* 2013 Annual Conference
* Richmond, VA
 
#### Workshop Description:
Audio and video equipment is complex and specialized.  There are rules and best practices for using this  equipment properly, but this information is often not taught well, or at all.  It’s left to the archivist in the field  to learn by trial and error, or through colleagues, how equipment and systems are supposed to function.  This  workshop will provide fundamental technical knowledge that is needed to understand, connect and operate  equipment that archivists use on a daily basis‐‐including video displays, audio mixers, VTRs and associated  devices.  We will discuss proper interconnection, operation and troubleshooting, with an emphasis on  practical application, plus some underlying theory.
